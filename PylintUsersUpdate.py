  Just a quick update on the Pylint library. To see the same report that I do in the video,
   in the newest version of PyLint you need to add -r y (report yes) at the end of the command,
   so the full command should be:

pylint myexample.py -r y

If you check out the video I only wrote pylint myexample.py , you will need to add on -r y

 How to use pylint
 1- install pylint from the command line type 'pip install pylint' hit enter
 2- go to your text editor, create a file and save it on desktop as .py extension( such as Simple.py) 
 3- open that file and write your code on that file you saved on desktop, control + s to save the changes
