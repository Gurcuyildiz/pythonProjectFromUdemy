#This should be the first line of the cell
%%writefile myfile.txt
#then we can write a plain text here
Hello this is a text file
This is the second line
This is the third line

myfile = open('myfile.txt')#no error as file is there and exist

myfile = open('whoops_wrongt.txt')# will give error as there is no such file, File not found error

#will return the content of file
myfile.read()#returns everything as a single string so strng will have backspace init

#as we have read the file now the cursor is at the end of line so if we try to read the file againg,
#it will return an empty file
myfile.read()# ''

##we have to set the cursor back to the top line
myfile.seek(0)# will give 0 then
myfile.read() # will give content


#can be assigned the content
myfile.seek(0)
contents = myfile.read()

myfile.seek(0)
myfile.readlines()#grab the list of text

myfile.close()# close the file in order not to get error




if we open a file in this path then we dont have to close it
with open('myfile.txt') as my_new_file:
     contents = my_new_file.read()
#we can read the content with contents variable we saved above
contents



#mode='r' =>read only
#mode='w' =>write only(will overwrite files & creates new if the file doesnt exist)
#mode='a' =>append only(will add on to files), a new line to
#mode='r+' => reading and writing
#mode='w+' => writing & reading (overwrites existing files or creates a new file0

with open('myfile.txt', mode='r') as myfile:
     contents =myfile.read() #will return the content

with open('defg.text', mode='w') as f :#write the file
     f.write('I created this file')
with open('defg.txt', mode='r') as f:#read the created file
     print(f.read())

#if we change the mode from read to write, will get error of :UnsupportedOperation: Not readable
with open('myfile.txt', mode='w')  as myfile:
     contents =myfile.read()


#####################
##FILE LOCATIONS
#if you want to open another file at another locations on your computer, simple pass in the entire file path
For Windows you need to use double \ so python doesn't treat the second \ as an escape character,
a path file is in the form
myfile = open("C:\\Users\\UserName\\Folder\\test.txt")

For Mac and Linux, use slashes in the opposite direction
myfile = open("/Users/YouUserName/Folder/myfile.txt")
